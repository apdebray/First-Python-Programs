Every code submitted above was done for class assignments. 

1. HW 1 was a business calculator that I had to create. It was my first Python assignment ever!
2. SIMs involved creating a product catalog and adding features that allowed you to make live changes to that catalog. 
3. Lab 3 Debray was my 3rd assignment where I needed to analyze a text document for important words to be analyzed for business decisions.
4. Lab 3 Numpy for Datasets really was my fourth assignment where I created matrices and edited them -- learned about more efficient less consuming methods to find data in code.
5. Lab 5: I analyzed a Netflix dataset using Python's visualization tools with seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot
6. Premier League Project plus its accompanied report is the classe's final project. With a classmate, I analyzed data from a Kaggle dataset on the Premier League and created data visualizations that would be of help to a sports betting business.
