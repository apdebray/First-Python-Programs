# ðŸ“š First Python Programs â€“ Armand Debray

This repository showcases my early journey into Python programming through a series of class assignments. From basic calculators to full-blown data analytics and catalog management tools, this portfolio captures both foundational learning and applied problem-solving.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

### ðŸ§® HW 1 â€“ Business Calculator
A multi-functional command-line calculator that handles:
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Geometric area/volume calculations
- Unit conversions (e.g., meters to feet, lbs to kgs)
- Business formulas like compound interest and break-even points  
**Tools:** `math`, `input/output logic`, `try/except` handling

---

### ðŸ›’ SIMS_Code â€“ Dynamic Product Catalog
A simulated e-commerce system:
- Tracks stock, units sold, and revenue per product
- Records and timestamps each sale
- Supports product updates (price or stock)
- Identifies top sellers and total revenue  
**Tools:** `datetime`, dictionaries, modular design

---

### ðŸ“Š Lab 3 â€“ Feedback Sentiment Analyzer
Reads real customer feedback and classifies it into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiment using keyword matching. Outputs:
- Summary statistics
- Top keywords by sentiment
- Text-based bar charts for visualization  
**Tools:** `re`, `Counter`, custom parsing

---

### ðŸ§  Lab 3 â€“ NumPy for Datasets
Hands-on with:
- Matrix slicing and filtering
- Customer segmentation (basic, silver, gold)
- Sales tracking and visualization
- Manual linear regression with MSE calculation  
**Tools:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `DataFrame` manipulation

---

### ðŸ“º HW 5 â€“ Netflix Data Visualization
Cleaned and visualized Netflix metadata:
- Movie vs. TV distribution
- Content duration and rating breakdowns
- Year-by-year release trends  
**Tools:** `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

---

### âš½ Premier League Final Project
Used a Kaggle dataset of EPL match stats to:
- Analyze possession vs. scoring
- Run t-tests for game outcome insights
- Visualize trends by matchweek
- Provide business insights for sports betting platforms  
**Tools:** `pandas`, `scipy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

---

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Beginner object-oriented design
- Statistical analysis (t-tests, regression)
- Matrix and array operations
- Visualization for business storytelling
